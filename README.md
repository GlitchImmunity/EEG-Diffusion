# EEG-Project
This is a deep learning classification of EEG signals using CNN, CNN-LSTM, CNN-MHA. Training data was also used to create a 1D diffusion model that would produce synthetic EEG samples using a linear beta scheduler.

Here is a link to the [paper](paper.pdf) containing the motivation and process behind the project. This was done in a similar style to CVPR format.

This was for a class project, so the paper is formatted oddly. The first 4 pages are abstract, introduction, results, discussion, and references. The following pages are for our methods and results.
