# EEG-Project
This is a deep learning classification of EEG signals using CNN, CNN-LSTM, CNN-MHA. Training data was also used to create a 1D diffusion model that would produce synthetic EEG samples using a linear beta scheduler.

Here is a link to the [paper](paper.pdf) containing the motivation and process behind the project. This was done in the CVPR format.
